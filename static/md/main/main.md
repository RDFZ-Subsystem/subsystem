Welcome to Reciter!

In order for you to better use Reciter, please read the following tips first

### 1. Create a vocabulary

On the new page, enter the form name (up to $64$ characters), the word information, and select the difficulty!

You can delete or modify the vocabulary you create

#### (1) For terms without example sentences/explanations
Format requirements: If there are $n$($n$is a positive integer) words, then you will enter a total of $2n$lines. For each word, the first act is English, the second act is Chinese, enter each word in turn (there can be Spaces in each line)

Example:
```
hello
hello
banana
Banana
```

#### (2) For vocabulary with example sentences/explanations

Format requirements: If there are $n$($n$is a positive integer) words, then you will enter a total of $3n$lines. For each word, enter the first word in English, the second in Chinese, and the third in an example/explanation (there can be Spaces in each line).

Please select the option `Include example sentence/explanation` in the drop-down list

Note: If there is no example sentence for this word, please use "example" and other characters in the line, otherwise there will be recognition problems

Example:

```
hello
hello

banana

(CASE)
```

#### tips:

- [PeterLu](https://subsystem.top/profile?username=PeterLu) needs to give the criteria for difficulty grading. [Bronia](https://subsystem.top/profile?username=Bronia) doesn't know the specific grading

### 2. Recite vocabulary lists
#### (1) Enter the vocabulary
You can search the vocabulary name or find the vocabulary you want to memorize by `List ID` jump and so on

Enter the vocabulary list and click on `Learn meaning` to recite the meaning, and `Learn spelling` to recite the spelling

#### (2) A description of the information presented during recitation

After entering recitation mode, you will see two numbers and `first time`.

The first number indicates the number of remaining words. The second number indicates how many more times the word needs to be recited, each word defaults to two times, and the number will be $-1$ when recited correctly.

When the second digit is cleared, the total number of words corresponds to $-1$.

If you encounter the word for the first time, the top will show 'first time', if the first time to recite correctly (or choose to know the meaning), the second number will be directly cleared to zero, and the total number of direct $-1$

#### (3) Quick use tips

The single-line input field in `Learn spelling` mode automatically enters the input state for quick input. In particular, you can do everything in this mode using only the keyboard

In `Learn spelling` mode, when You mistype a word and enter the prompt page, the system doesn't check to see if you typed it correctly in the box. This means you can simply press `Enter` or click the `Continue` button to skip.

`Learn meaning` Support keyboard quick jump, key corresponding to the following
